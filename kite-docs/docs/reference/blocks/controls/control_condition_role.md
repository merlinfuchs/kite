# Role Condition

<EmbedFlowNode type="control_condition_role" />

The `Role Condition` block allows you to create conditional logic based on role properties or characteristics. You can set up multiple role-based conditions that will execute different actions.

This is useful for creating role-based permissions or role-specific behavior.

<NodeInfoExplorer type="control_condition_role" />
