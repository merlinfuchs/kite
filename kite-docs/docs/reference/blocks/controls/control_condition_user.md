# User Condition

<EmbedFlowNode type="control_condition_user" />

The `User Condition` block allows you to create conditional logic based on user properties or characteristics. You can set up multiple user-based conditions that will execute different actions.

This is useful for creating user-specific behavior or permission-based flows.

<NodeInfoExplorer type="control_condition_user" />
