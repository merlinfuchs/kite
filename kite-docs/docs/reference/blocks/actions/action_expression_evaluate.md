# Calculate Value

The `Calculate Value` block allows you to evaluate mathematical expressions or perform logical operations. You can use this to perform calculations, string manipulations, or other data processing tasks.

See [Expressions](/reference/expressions) for more information on what you can do with expressions.

The result can be stored in a temporary variable and used in subsequent blocks.
