# Get Roblox User

<EmbedFlowNode type="action_roblox_user_get" />

The `Get Roblox User` block allows you to retrieve information about a Roblox user by their ID or username. This is useful for creating integrations with Roblox or building features that work with Roblox user data.

You can look up users by their Roblox ID or username, and the block will return information about the user.
