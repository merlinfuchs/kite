# Delete message reaction

The `Delete message reaction` block is used to remove a reaction from a specific message.

The emoji can be a standard emoji or a custom emoji. The emoji picker only shows custom emojis that are uploaded to the app by going to the `Emojis` tab in the Kite dashboard.

<EmbedFlowNode type="action_message_reaction_delete" />
