# Listen for Event

<EmbedFlowNode type="entry_event" />

The `Listen for Event` block is the entry point for event-triggered flows. This block listens for specific Discord events and triggers your flow when they occur.

You can configure which event type to listen for and add filters to control when the flow should be triggered.

<NodeInfoExplorer type="entry_event" />
