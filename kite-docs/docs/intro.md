# Welcome to Kite! 🪁

I'm happy you found your way to the Kite documentation!

This is the place where you will find information regarding setting up your Discord bot and getting started with Kite. Kite is still very much work in progress and many features are not yet ready or just not documented.

If you want to keep track of the progress or even contribute you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/merlinfuchs/kite) or join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rNd9jWHnXh).

## What's Kite?

Kite is an open source platform for building and hosting Discord bots without the need to write a single line of code. It's powered by an advanced no-code editor and tries to be as beginner friendly as possible.

While there are already solutions for building Discord bots without the need to code, most of them feel clunky, are missing features, or are not beginner friendly. With Kite I want to close that gap and provide all types of users with the necessary tools to built their own bots.

Ready? Get started [here](/guides/getting-started)!
