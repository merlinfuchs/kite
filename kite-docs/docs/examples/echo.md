# Beginner - Echo Command

A simple echo command that repeats your texts to get new users started with the basic  structure and feature of the command builder.

## Creating your command
- Go to commands section of your Kite dashboard and make a command with the name echo.

## Adding arguments to your command
- Now that you've created your command, go to `Options` section of your command builder and select the **Command Arguments** block.
- Connect this block to the little purple dot of your command name.
- Inside the **Command Arguments** block settings, add these :
        - **Name** - `text`
        - **Description** - `text to echo`
        - **Argument Type** - Text
        - **Argument Required** - True

:::note
Arguments name can only be in small letters and can't contain any special characters except for an underscore (\_).
If you want to add a space in argument's name use the underscore (\_).
:::

## Sending your message
- From the actions menu, select the **Create Channel Message** block.
- Set the target channel as `{{channel.id}}`
- Click **Edit Message** and then **Add embed**
        - In the description box, put `{{arg('text')}}`
        - For the Author section, put `{{user.username}}` in the name field and `{{user.avatar_url}}` in the Icon URL field.
- Exit the message editor.

## Acknowledging your command
:::info
Discord requires interactions (slash commands, modals & buttons) to compulsorily have a "response" otherwise it shows a red alert on your screend saying "This interaction failed." even if your command works as expected. To prevent this, we use the **Create Response** block.
:::

- Add the **Create Response Message** block after the previous block.
- In the response field type anything acknowledging that user's command is successful. (for eg. "doneso")
- Scroll down on the block settings, and turn off the "Public Response" to make it visible only to the user who ran the command.

## Save your command
- Click **Save Changes** at the top of your page.
- Voil√†! You've created your first command.
- Refresh your Discord client and run the command in your server.
